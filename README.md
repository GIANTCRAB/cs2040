# CS2040 Data Structures and Algorithms

Originally written for the NUS module CS2040, adapted to have Kattis questions answered in Kotlin.

You may view my Kattis submissions and attempts on the Kattis website: [https://open.kattis.com/users/huiren-woo](https://open.kattis.com/users/huiren-woo)

If you would like me to try to attempt/answer any of the questions available in Kattis, feel free to create an issue. However, I cannot guarantee that I'll be smart enough to be able to complete the question.
